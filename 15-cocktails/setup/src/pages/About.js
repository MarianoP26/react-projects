      <p>Cocktails are great, cocktails are life, life is a cocktail and
        tail is not a cock nor a cock is a tail but it all depends
        on the subjective perception of each of everyone of us.
        Great is good and great are the cocktails but that does NOT mean
        tailcocks are good nor bad. Once again, it all depends. 
        Not everything is written tho it should be. God is watching
        but you can NOT watch God, so buy a watch.
